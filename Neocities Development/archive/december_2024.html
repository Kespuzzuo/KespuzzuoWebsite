                                <p class="news_date">December 13, 2024</p>
                                <p>I'd like to invite onto the stage the father of the Playstation...</p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>The great... Super Famicom!!!</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>I know what goes on, so I avoid TGA drama as much as possible, see stuff with an unbiased mind, and just myself feel entertained at whatever happens.</p>
                                <p>One thing that always comes up is the voting, but I couldn't care less about the voting. Another thing is the demand for sequels, remakes, and spin-offs, rather than original IPs, which is something curious.</p>
                                <p>In the movie industry, the script's completely flipped, because the box office hits were mostly composed of sequels, remakes, and spin-offs, and the internet people instead were talking about how they instead wanted original films.</p>
                                <p>Could be a demographics thing, or a matter of how a game is consumed in comparison to a movie.</p>
                                <p>I do feel sorry for game developers, specially indie ones, who try to put out original ideas, while the comments keep talking about how they want the sequels to their favorite games.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Also, I'm glad I've been watching iconic movies in the latest days. I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark some days before, and seeing Harrison Ford walk onto the stage with the Indiana Jones theme going on felt like a good payoff.</p>
                                <p>Some days ago on the Steam sale I got Core Keeper, and was surprised to see the developers announce a new game, something similar to Terraria, sort of like Core Keeper in the Terraria format.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>I didn't watch the whole thing. I'm an early bird, so I went to sleep during the middle.</p>
                                <p>I did like some of what I saw, though.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Regarding gaming - An update on the future PC</h3>
                                <p>So I actually budgeted the other parts of the future PC, and it might cost between $1500 and $1600 dollars. I think I'll raise the budget to $1600-1800 to account for shipping costs and the risk of prices increasing.</p>
                                <p>I have an idea. Instead of announcing a single comm slot on each milestone, I might start opening two at a time, since I got plenty of time to draw right now. I will also be designing characters during the year to let people adopt them.</p>

                            <header class="news_title">Figuring out about my future PC</header>
                            <div class="news_content">
                                <p class="news_date">December 12, 2024</p>
                                <p>I think I got an idea of how I'd like my future computer to be like.</p>
                                <p>The three previous computers I had were all laptops. The reason why I've been using laptops is because of the risk of blackouts, and if I have to take it to the campus. But, I think I shouldn't worry too much now about these two factors. Blackouts only happen in winter, and usually it only happens once a year. I think I could get a UPS. As for uni, I think I'm completely able to do 90% of the computer work I do at the campus with either a tablet or with the computers available at the library. Plus, Winlator is now a thing, so I can actually run Windows programs on my tablet if I really must do it.</p>
                                <p>What I'm getting at is that I want my next computer to be a desktop computer, and I want to build it myself. Since I was able to upgrade my current computer, tinker with other electronics at home, and easily learn skills like cooking, I think I could easily be able to follow along and build a computer on my own. I think another good thing about it would be the price. My current laptop has a really good CPU, but the GPU is not so good. It's pretty good for Minecraft, 6th gen titles, and indies. But it thermal throttles at new games. I tried the Metaphor: ReFantazio demo and struggles to run fine. I bought Psychonauts 2 on Steam during the Autumn sale, but had to refund it because of how it also made my computer thermal throttle. Thing is, getting a laptop with a better GPU has a steep price laddering. Going from one tier to another costs a loooot! One has more control with desktop PCs because you can pick the parts and choose if you want them new or used.</p>
                                <p>So, here's the plan, I want to keep this PC on a $1000-1500 price range, where the CPU is a simple improvement, while the GPU is a big improvement, and here's how I want it to be like:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>CPU: AMD 5700X3D</li>
                                    <li>Motherboard: AM4</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I heard that the X3D chips are good. Intel's been having a rough path with their three newest gens. I myself have been using Intel, but, my dad's been using AMD and I think he likes his computer. I think I'll be definitely getting AMD this time around, and I want one of those X3D chips. I'm completely fine with the old 5700X3D, since it's cheap compared to the newer ones, and yet, it still performs even better than my current CPU, which is a pretty good one.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>GPU: Nvidia 3080/4070 Super (Refurbished or used)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This will be the most expensive part of the build. But, I think this will be worth it, and it'll solve all (or most) of these problems of me not being able to enjoy a modern game smoothly. I think this will keep this computer on a pretty good state for like 6-8 years.</p>
                                <p>Plus, I'm convinced that I want a used GPU rather than a new one, because the prices should be lower, the quality should be similar, it should not persuade Nvidia to keep its prices high, and it would be better for the environment.</p>
                                <p>It'll just come down to whatever offers are available at the moment I get the funds to buy it. I don't even know what the 50 series will do, so I'm not thinking about it at the moment.</p>
                                <p>And there's the rest...</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Memory: 32GB</li>
                                    <li>Case: ATX</li>
                                    <li>Storage: two 1TB M.2 SSDs (for multibooting and for storing games and stuff) + my already existing external drives (for storing other stuff)</li>
                                    <li>Mouse: same one I've been always using</li>
                                    <li>Headphones: same ones I've been always using</li>
                                    <li>Keyboard: Something thin enough to fit the drawing tablet and monitor into the desk</li>
                                    <li>Monitor: 1080p 144hz</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Yup, I'm completely fine with this. I would much rather have this resolution with a smooth framerate rather than a higher resolution with a worse framerate. Plus, this is my current resolution.</p>
                                <p>And that might be it. I think that, for budgeting this, I'll keep it at $1500, which would be funded by a mix of future art money and my family giving some parts as gifts. Whatever money's left could be added to the "Condo downpayment fund".</p>
                                <p>I think I'll be able to fulfill that budget in a year.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Regarding life - Maintenance</h3>
                                <p>I think I've been way too good at losing weight, so now I'm actually measuring how many calories I can eat per day. I think I spend 1600-1800 calories by just "living" each day. 400 more calories are spent by walking 10k-ish steps a day, which I do each day. And 400 more calories go away with a workout I do each Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.</p>
                                <p>Which means I got room for eating plenty of food. That would be like 2000-2200 calories on days without workouts and 2400-2600 calories on days with workouts. Today I ate scrambled eggs for breakfast, which would be like 300-400 calories. I'll have chicken with a tomato for lunch, which also will be like 400 calories. I ate 2 ounces of chocolate eggs during the day, which was like 350 calories. All of this means I would still have like 1400 calories to eat. That's a lot of potential food! I ran out of chocolate eggs right now, so I think I'll have to figure out what else I could eat, something with a lot of value in terms of flavor vs calories.</p>
                                <p>That Saturday when I had an ice cream, I had a 4 scoop ice cream, plus some of my mom's unfinished ice cream, and a brownie, and I was still able to maintain.</p>

                            <div class="news_content">
                                <p class="news_date">December 8, 2024</p>
                                <p>I made a breading made out of ground almonds, cashews, and peanuts. After using it on the air fryer for some hake, it was pretty good. Thing is, I'm trying to get it to stick to the food I put it on. I did use egg wash, consisting of whole eggs, water and milk, but I couldn't manage to get the hake to fully get covered by the nuts.</p>
                                <p>It's the first time I'm actually doing fried hake with my own batter, so I think it's fine I made some mistakes.</p>
                                <p>I'm going to admit it. I am at that point where I'm avoiding restaurants as much as possible, because I want to make my food my own way. Looking at a restaurant's menu at a website is only useful for me to reverse engineer their recipes and then replicate them with my own ingredients, methods, and adjustments to make sure everything goes the way I want.</p>
                                <p>The thing is that, I don't want to eat from restaurants anymore, because as I learn more about cooking, I learn about what happens in the culinary world. When I look up some recipes, I've seen some cooks use sugar in savory plates. I've been fine making my own savory plates without adding any sugar at all. And if multiple cooks are doing this, then there's a chance restaurants are doing it as well. Sort of reminds me of that episode of Malcolm in the Middle where Hal is sneaking in high-calorie foods into Lois' food in order to make her fat.</p>
                                <p>The reason why I was making my own breading was because a new restaurant opened, and when my family was calling to order food for it (to try how it was), I asked for no sugar. My dad couldn't fathom why I was asking for no sugar on a fried hake. Minutes after the order was placed, we got a call from the restaurant where they said they always placed sugar in their frying batter.</p>
                                <p>I'll just decide to not eat there. If other people are fine with their food, then so be it. I'll be eating my own fried hake instead.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Regarding art - New character</h3>
                                <p>I made a new character! His name is Laurentius and he's a Swadloon. He wears a bowtie.</p>
                                <p>Not many people have Swadloon OCs. I remember one which I liked, but then it was sold and I could never find the person who got them.</p>
                                <p>According to my new year resolutions, I only have to make one more character, and that will be it for the year!</p>
                                <p>Another idea I have for fulfilling my new year resolutions is that the music tracks could be... character themes.</p>

                            <div class="news_content">
                                <p class="news_date">December 7, 2024</p>
                                <p>This morning I finished Kirby and the Forgotten Land. This might be my favorite Kirby game. Planet Robobot might be the second favorite one and also my favorite 2D-ish Kirby game. Triple Deluxe is probably my third favorite. They're all pretty good.</p>
                                <p>And yes, this is it. HAL pumped out all of their creativity into this one, and they pulled off the 3D gameplay into Kirby really well. The gameplay loop of collecting not just waddle dees but also doing tiny tasks is also even better than the sun stone and code block collection gameplay from the 3DS games.</p>
                                <p>The story and setting are amazing too, each part of the world looks interesting and full of life!</p>
                                <p>I played on Wild Mode. The difficulty was fine, not too easy, nor too challenging. It was harder during some of the treasure road stages, but then when the colosseum opened, the game sort of got easier because I could get rare stones easily. I didn't mind that.</p>
                                <p>This game does have that thing Kirby games do where most of the story is shown at the end, and tiny pieces during the rest of the game, but, it still delivered a good amount of lore before the end. I could say it was an adecuate amount.</p>
                                <p>I finished the game, but I know there's a big post-game after this. Might pick it up from time to time if I feel like playing more of it.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Regarding life - A recipe</h3>
                                <p>So, today I made a keto double burger. I think my burgers end up being delicious, I like them more than most of the ones I've found at restaurants.</p>
                                <p>If you want to know how today's burger was like, it was like this...</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Two lettuce leaves</li>
                                    <li>A bit of mustard</li>
                                    <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
                                    <li>Salami</li>
                                    <li>Patty</li>
                                    <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
                                    <li>Salami</li>
                                    <li>Patty</li>
                                    <li>A pickle sliced into six pieces</li>
                                    <li>Garlic paste mixed with a bit of mayo</li>
                                    <li>Two lettuce leaves</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The lettuce leaves were washed, dried, and then I put a bit of salt in them. The patties were also washed, dried, and I put some salt, pepper, oregano and tiny garlic pieces on them. The patties were also pan fried.</p>
                                <p>It ended up being juicy. The patties had a good taste, and let some juice out that got mixed with some of the mayo and garlic paste after dripping onto my plate.</p>
                                <p>This evening I'll also be having some ice cream!</p>

                            <div class="news_content">
                                <p class="news_date">December 4, 2024</p>
                                <p>So I heard that people are getting their Spotify Wrapped. Unfortunately, it's for mobile only, and I don't want to go through the ordeal of going from the web app to the mobile app, because I have it set up in a different country so the main page is different. I will not look at my Spotify Wrapped.</p>
                                <p>There's an alternative, and possibly something better than Spotify Wrapped: Volt.FM. It gives the same kind of data that Wrapped gives, but I don't have to log into mobile. According to this, the artist I've listened to the most this year was Alicesoft, followed by Mamomo, and then Queen (I was going through their discography for the sake of completion, with the exception of the Flash Gordon album)</p>
                                <p>I'm leaving Spotify, because there's no button or option to stop it from recommending artists I don't like, and neither there's an option for blocking these artists from appearing on recommendations or on ads. I wouldn't give them any pennies either, because I don't want to fund them, knowing both their history, and because of the artists they've promoted.</p>
                                <p>I'm still adding songs to the December playlist, but, there will be one final album I'll add, and after that, I'll listen to music on whatever platform I want, while logging what I listen to on RYM.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Regarding life - Let's talk about tomatoes instead</h3>
                                <p>I ate green cocktail tomatoes today, I think they tasted like green apples.</p>
                                <p>I usually tend to have a tomato, or a group of cocktail tomatoes, on the side of my lunch. It's a way to satiate my hunger without consuming a lot of calories. Tomatoes don't have a lot of taste, so I sprinkle a bit of salt, and dip them in mustard. If it's a normal tomato, I just grab it and eat it like an apple, and I don't even peel it. If I'm having cocktail tomatoes, I just pick them up with a fork.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Also, whatever you do, don't use an unripe avocado for a shake. I did that this morning and it didn't blend in, it just became a group of unripe avocado crumbles swimming inside the non-creamy shake I had.</p>
                                <p>I could have waited for the avocados to age, but, I wanted to deplete the milk, because it was close to its expiration date.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Regarding gaming - What I got at the Steam Sale</h3>
                                <p>The Steam Sale is over, and I got Cities Skylines, since it was at a huge discount. I also got Spark the Electric Jester, and Core Keeper. I got Core Keeper because I watched someone play it, and it looked interesting. It's like Minecraft, where you gather resources. It also has mods!</p>
                                <p>But I'll leave these games in the backlog for now, because I'm trying to finish Kirby and the Forgotten Land and a few other games.</p>

                                <p>This year is wrapping up, my house's with all the Christmas decorations, and the TV's playing Christmas ads. It'll be Christmas in no time, and same for the New Year.</p>
                                <p>I'm happy with this year. I promised I would draw at least 60 drawings, and I've managed to draw even more than that. I also promised to finish Skygardening, and here it is! There's three resolutions I want to take care of, which is fixing some things on this website (A proper 404 page, and a proper banner), revealing 2 new characters, and posting 3 tracks of music by me.</p>
                                <p>I'm nearly done with uni for the year, and I'll be getting that bachelor's degree really soon! I'm doing very well at it as well.</p>
                                <p>Also, here's the <a class="purplelink" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/14iF7EqjJ3b1nGiaboaKEZ">November music playlist.</a> Which I believe might be over 100 hours long, with 1707 tracks. Oh, and here's the <a class="purplelink" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Gf9v6N6k8uRKa4fZ8PoPP">December music playlist.</a> I think that'll be the last one, since I'm gonna use RYM's <i>Play History</i> function from now on. I'll also be reviewing some music after listening to it, since that'll leave my mark on the world.</p>
