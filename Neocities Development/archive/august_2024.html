                            <header class="news_title">Sushi rolls</header>
                            <div class="news_content">
                                <p class="news_date">Aug 31, 2024</p>
                                <p>There's another thing I want to learn: sushi rolls.</p>
                                <p>And I think it's useful that I learn how to make them, since it's food.</p>
                                <p>That might mean that I'll be able to have sushi at a lower price, since I'm making it myself.</p>
                                <p>Now then, as for what rolls I wanna make, I've been thinking of the following</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Rolls wrapped in avocado or salmon.</li>
                                    <li>Rolls wrapped by an omelet.</li>
                                    <li>Rolls wrapped in lettuce.</li>
                                    <li>Actually how to put salmon or tuna in rolls, and how to take it for lunch to the campus without risking illnesses.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>So the thing about that one is that I have no idea how I'll be able to carry raw fish in a roll when I go outside. Maybe I'll have to ask if the glass containers I use are good at it. Or if that doesn't work, maybe I could try using cooked or even smoked salmon for when I want to go out, and keep the raw salmon for when I'm gonna eat immediatly after making the roll. I've even thought of putting ice cubes inside the container, or even bringing the roll inside one of those metallic bottles that keep things cool for hours.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Rolls with shrimp inside.</li>
                                    <li>And also the ones with fried shrimp.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>So I looked up at the store that usually sells shrimp, and they tend to sell shrimp in plastic bags (that cannot be resealed) with like 18 oz (500 grams) of shrimp in them, and of course that'll last several rolls. Of course, the bag is stored in the freezer, but, I wonder if it's okay to store the bag if I haven't used all of the shrimp in there. Maybe they'll be okay in the freezer.</p>
                                <p>At the store there's also shrimps that are already battered, so I only need to put them inside an air fryer to fry them.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Rolls with chicken inside.</li>
                                    <li>Rolls with salami or sausage.</li>
                                    <li>Rolls with scrambled eggs inside.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I'm good at preparing scrambled eggs, so I think I'll enjoy this</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Chives and cream cheese in rolls.</li>
                                    <li>Rolls without rice.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Yes, I think I'm okay with having sushi without rice, specially when I'm going keto. I know that it's crazy. I think I can just put the ingredients inside the nori, and then just wrap the nori with two avocados, salmon, or even an omelet.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>So, that's basically what I want to make. That sums it up, except for those rolls that are deep fried, since I think that'll require filling a pot with a lot of oil, and I don't want to be using too much oil.</p>

                                <p>Eventually, if I keep writing post after post here, there will be too many things to load, so I decided that older posts will be placed in an archive.</p>
                                <p>So the idea I'm having is that in this page, the homepage, only the posts from the current month are displayed, and whenever the month is over, all the posts from that month will be moved to the archive.</p>
                                <p>The archive is organized by years, and then months. Each month has its own page.</p>

                                <h3>Regarding lore - Robobot arc prelude</h3>
                                <p>On the last update I mentioned that the Robobot arc will have a story set a lot of time before. I got a brilliant idea. I think there can be a smooth transition between Skygardening (the Triple Deluxe story) and this prelude. My idea is that the protagonist will be a spider from Floralia.</p>
                                <h3>Regarding web development - Stacks</h3>
                                <p>So right now I've been establishing that I got a stack consisting of</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>HTML</li>
                                    <li>CSS</li>
                                    <li>A bit of Javascript</li>
                                    <li>VS Codium</li>
                                    <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I've been looking for ways in how I can improve that. I've looked at other "languages" that could aid in web development, but they're either something I have no use for at the moment  (ex: Any database language) or is one of those languages that takes code and just processes it into CSS or Javascript (ex: Sass and Typescript), or is a library that needs installing and might not work here.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Perhaps I don't need to learn a new language. I think it would be better for me to be an expert in 3 languages rather than being a beginner in 10 languages.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>In that case, I think I'll try to find uses for Javascript and then learn more about it.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>I'm also getting good at CSS, I've been reading a book about responsive design. That book has already helped me with making this website work on phones. Hah, I used to not care about phones at all, because I had bad experiences from mobile websites where the developers made the mobile version suck by taking away many of the features of the desktop version.</p>
                                <h3>Regarding holidays - Thinking about Halloween already</h3>
                                <p style="font-size:10px;line-height:1.0;">and Christmas too.</p>
                                <p>So Christmas is coming in 4 months... and people start anticipating it for 2 months.</p>
                                <p>But Halloween is also coming in 2 months, and September is just around the corner...</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>I got my Halloween plans set somehow. I am putting out the things to thaw so I can "cook" my Halloween and October content.</p>
                                <p>Kirby's Return to Dreamland was released almost 13 years ago on October of 2011. I could possibly make something Magolor or Halcandran related.</p>
                                <p style="font-size:10px;line-height:1.0;">Yes, I am aware that Magolor is not a Halcandran.</p>
                                <p>But perhaps there's something more fitting for the ocassion, for that mood, of spookyness.</p>
                                <p>I'll keep those thawing Halloween ingredients a secret! I got a very specific modus operandi that works in a very specific way. You might not even believe it will work. But, you can have my "trust me bro" warranty for the moment.</p>
                                <p>As for Christmas... I think I should already be thinking about what I want.</p>
                                <p>Each year, my family asks what should be the gift that would be the most fitting for me, and I have no idea on what to get.</p>
                                <p>Must be on a specific price range, not too cheap, nor too expensive. Must be something I don't own. And something I like.</p>
                                <p>Hopefully, I got these 4 months to find it.</p>

                                <h3>What's after Skygardening</h3>
                                <p>Skygardening was basically my take on Kirby Triple Deluxe and Kirby and The Amazing Mirror. It was mostly Sectonia (as a spider) and others exploring the mirror world and dealing with Dark Mind themselves. But now I'm thinking of what other Kirby games I could make stories out of.</p>
                                <p>Return to Dreamland, Planet Robobot and Star Allies are connected plotwise, so I'm thinking of doing a whole story arc that connects the three. And here's how I'm thinking of doing it:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A visual novel-style series of videos (think of the Christmas Comeback Crisis) set some months after Skygardening, and basically being the "main dish" of this story arc.</li>
                                    <li>A prequel story setting place a lot of years before to build up some backstory. It might not be a book, nor a visual novel.</li>
                                    <li>Short stories regarding characters that will participate in the arc, like Magolor, Povynn, Sectonia, and others.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>In other news</h3>
                                <p>During this week I'm having the first tests of this semester, so I won't be doing too much in terms of content. I'm so close to getting my bachelor's degree.</p>

                                <p>So here I am, designing a box that holds a news article, or update.</p>

                                <p>I think I could come up with a better way to write these news. I could put each new on a box with it's title and all. I also wanna make an archive of all of these news I'm making, organized by the month where they were posted.</p>
