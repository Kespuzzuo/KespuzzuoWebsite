                                <p class="news_date">March 17, 2025</p>
                                <p>So I've been jumping in and out of Blender just to get a hold of it. Opening a cube file and trying to turn it into a graphics card, or opening a sphere and writing stuff on top of it with the sculpt tools.</p>
                                <p>One of my New Year Resolutions is to model myself (Povynn), rig myself and put the 3d model in a game. But, another thing I thought I could do is to mod a car into a car game. I'd like to mod purraris into games.</p>
                                <p>Maybe I could mod it into the original Outrun arcade, or at least the Sega Genesis port. I think I should just figure how to change the color palette and change some pixels.</p>
                                <p>I'd also like to put a Purrari on Need For Speed: Most Wanted 2005, which would consist on modding any existing Ferrari mod into the game, and then figuring out how to put the Nyan cat stickers there. I chose that game since it would be a double whammy for messing with Ferrari, since they also chose to not let their games appear in street racing games because they "damage their image".</p>
                                <p>And here comes the biggest one of them all. The final level. I'm thinking of doing a challenge where I port a Biddybuggy from Mario Kart 8 into NR2003 and then making a Nyan cat paint scheme for it. It'll be called the Purrybuggy.</p>

                            <div class="news_content">
                                <p class="news_date">March 16, 2025</p>
                                <p>So I got Forza Horizon 5. It looked like a fun game to play and it often appeared on benchmark videos, so I decided to try it, and it was worth it. I had previously played Forza Motorsport 5, but, I felt like that one was more like a tech demo to "show the power of the Xbox One". This Forza is different, I'm having fun getting cars, making them go fast and exploring Mexico.</p>
                                <p>There was a Nascar race today, and since I know that this game has car customization options, I decided to grab a Ford Mustang and <a class="purplelink" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3445825611">give it Joey Logano's paint scheme.</a></p>
                                <p>Then, after watching the race, I went back to the game, and I was given a free ferrari, and that's when I had a stroke of genius. I was reminded of deadmau5 being forced to sell his Ferrari away because the company didn't want their cars to be modified like that. So I went ahead and made my free Ferrari a <a class="purplelink" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3446190390">Purrari.</a></p>
                                <p>And then it gets even better. I went to a race, and then the game played the <a class="purplelink" href="https://youtu.be/FZb96lkxl-E?si=uboU2uQoYBJsISAy">song that was made by deadmau5</a> while I was running past everyone at the race. Oh, also. I made my player character Geralt of Rivia.</p>

                                <h3>Regarding Food - The Box Combo</h3>
                                <p>My city doesn't have a Raising Cane's, so I decided to make my own Box Combo. First thing I prepared was the sauce. This sauce includes ketchup, mayo, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I thought I wouldn't find Worcestershire sauce, but, apparently, I was able to find it. I never had it before. I made the sauce, and showed it to my family. My mom at first thought it was just mayo with ketchup, and I mentioned that it was like that but with more ingredients. She also mentioned it was too salty. I'm used to make my food saltier than other cooks do, so maybe this is just a "me" thing.</p>
                                <p>After that I made the coleslaw, I just picked up a salad kit (of green lettuce, purple lettuce, and carrot slices), and added mayo, pepper and lemon to it. Then I cooked the crinkle cut fries on the oven, the chicken on the air fryer, and also added the Texas Toast to the air fryer before the chicken was ready. The whole thing actually yielded two "servings", both of them apparently bigger due to the amount of fries, coleslaw, and sauce that I made. I served myself a homemade Box Combo with a can of Dr Pepper and enjoyed it.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Regarding gaming - Rocket League</h3>
                                <p>I played Rocket League for the first time and got hooked in pretty much instantly.</p>
                                <p>I know it was pretty popular years ago, but never bothered to play it. A week ago I saw a pic mocking one of the Nascar cars going airborne, with the Rocket League logo at the bottom. I also realized it's on the Epic "Epic MegaGames" Mega-launcher. So I made an account there, and downloaded the Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
                                <p>Plus, since my new computer is like... an "Esports computer", I thought it would be adequate to play some of it.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Speaking of Esports, I also wanted to mention that I played Marvel Rivals yesterday, but, I'm gonna admit, I'm not good at it. Nothing unusual, since this is the first time playing it. I think I'd have to study strats before playing again.</p>
