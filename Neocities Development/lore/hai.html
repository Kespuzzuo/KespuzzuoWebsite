                    <h1>Hai</h1>
                    <p><sup>From the Kespuzzuo Lore Compendium</sup></p>
                    <p><b>Hai</b> is a recurring character in the Kespuzzuo Fanwork Corpus, making his first appearance as one of the main characters in Skygardening. Hai is a Guardian Spirit who protects the forests along with Ty, but also goes to college and is working towards a degree in Computer Science. He also is Povynn's best friend.</p>
                    <h2 id="Physical_Appearance">Physical Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Hai looks very similar to how Ori does, and how one would expect a Guardian Spirit to look like; however, he is more human-like compared to most. Having normal hands and feet instead of hooves. He has two long ears and antennae that are longer than average for most spirits, and a long tail. His body is pure white, and has two pure white eyes to match. Hai's whole body is always glowing, the glow being an indicator of his health. He also has a bit of fluff on his chest and crotch. It also worth noting that Hai's legs are incredibly strong, and very much above average.</p>
                    <p>Most of the time, Hai is fully clothed. Sometimes he goes around without something, and sometimes even with nothing at all. He wears a wide variety of different types of clothes, colors, and patterns, so he always finds a way to stand out from the crowd.</p>
                    <h2 id="History">History</h2>
                    <h3 id="Before_Skygardening">Before Skygardening</h3>
                    <p>Early in life, Hai lived in Gateway, that was until he met Povynn during his travels. The two quickly hit it off and became almost inseparable from each other. When Povynn made his way back to Kiubelytte, he stayed in contact with him. When it was time for Hai to leave home for his first year of university, he moved in with the lakesprit and the two have been living together ever since.</p>
                    <h3 id="Skygardening">Skygardening</h3>
                    <p>In Skygardening, Hai was one of the members of the Council of the Seven Years. However, he visited Floralia for his own reasons, them being to go exploring with Echo the Audino and Rexford the Scolipede. However he stuck around Floralia after hearing Povynn was helping out Queen Sectonia, while his friends headed home. Hai first appeared in Book IV, where he first appeared to save Povynn from a knight mecha, and joined the Council of the Seven Years shortly after.</p>
                    <p>During the expedition in Old Odyssey, Hai originally went with the group before going on his own and learning a bit about Neblino. With this information, he attempted to assassinate him, but missed his head by a just a few inches, which caused Neblino to retreat, causing the chase to continue.</p>
                    <p>Like the rest of the council, Hai helped with fighting Dark Mind, a fight which the council won. After his defeat, he stayed in Floralia along with Povynn for another week, for relaxing and spending time with his friends.</p>
                    <h2 id="Abilities">Abilities</h2>
                    <p>Hai has many differnet abilities. He can pretty much do anything Ori could do, and a few more things to boot, as long as he has the energy to do so. This allows him to use many different light based attacks, light up darkness easily, restore his surroundings to previous states, and even cheat death in a way with Soul Links. Hai also has remarkable healing abilities, making him extremely valuable on things like long expeditions.</p>
                    <p>However, his main weapon is a Crossbow, and he carries both bolts made of light, and real bolts. The crossbow itself can hold 5 bolts per magazine, and Hai usually carries around 10 of them in his backpack for when he has to fight. Hai himself is a good sharpshooter, so he tries to stay out of trouble if he can.</p>
