                    <h1>Povynn</h1>
                    <p><sup>From the Kespuzzuo Lore Compendium</sup></p>
                    <p><b>Povynn</b> is a recurring character in the Kespuzzuo Fanwork Corpus, debuting as a supporting character in PMD: Starscape Weaver. Povynn is a lakesprit who works as psychologist doing research and therapy.</p>
                    <p>Just like how Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf deal with knowledge, emotion, and willpower respectively, Povynn deals with perception, and has abilities related to manipulating stimuli and illusions.</p>
                    <h2 id="Physical_Appearance">Physical Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Povynn looks similar to Uxie, Mesprit and Azelf, since he's a lakesprit like them. He has two long tails that end in hand-like appendages, with a pink gem on each one. His body is either short or as tall as an average adult human depending on whenever he's on his "standard" lakesprit form or his anthropomorphic form (which is also called the "anthro" form)</p>
                    <p>His body is of a light lavender color. His head partially shares that color and a light yellow color, which is lighter than Uxie's yellow head. On his head, he has a pink gem above his eyes, and two brown eyes. His head resembles a spiky hairstyle, with some strands at the front going downwards, the ones at the sides going upwards, and the highest one going to the right.</p>
                    <p>Most of the times, Povynn is seen wearing a white scarf with light yellow ends, each one of them having a little icon of a pink gem on them.</p>
                    <h2 id="History">History</h2>
                    <h3 id="Starscape_Weaver">PMD: Starscape Weaver</h3>
                    <p>Povynn moved to the PMD World to live there for a while. Emronia arrived at the PMD World shortly after, and was guided by Povynn in her adventure.</p>
                    <h3 id="Skygardening">Skygardening</h3>
                    <p>In <a class="redlink" href="/lore/skygardening.html">Skygardening</a>, Povynn, along with Emronia and Quentin, decided to visit Floralia. The trio found out that mirrors were banned there, and that the citizens were worried about an entity called Dark Mind. Shortly after, the trio met <a class="goldlink" href="/lore/taranza.html">Taranza</a>, and joined the Council of the Seven Years. For a week, Povynn and the council did excursions to the mirror world in order to find mirror shards.</p>
                    <p>During that week, Povynn met Neblino, and fell asleep after entering the Roundkick Lodge, which was the base of operations for Neblino and his allies. Other members of the council learned more about this, and decided to chase Neblino.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, Neblino was caught, but Neblino challenged the council to have a fight. Povynn stepped in and decided to fight Neblino. After Povynn won the fight, the council gathered all the mirror shards and completed the mirror that led towards Dark Mind's hideout.</p>
                    <p>Along with the rest of the council, Povynn helped with fighting Dark Mind. After Sectonia finished Dark Mind off, Povynn stayed in Floralia for another week, this time for relaxing and for spending time with the Floralians and the Queen.</p>
                    <h2 id="Abilities">Abilities</h2>
                    <p>Povynn has abilities related to the creation, inhibition, and modification of perception. This means that he can create visual, auditory, and tactile illusions. These illusions allow him to perform several "tricks", like playing a song or recording for himself or someone else without the need of speakers or headphones. Another "trick" he can do is showing audiovisual events (which could be called videos) to others without the need of a device. Creating illusions also allows him to make himself invisible whenever he needs to.</p>
                    <p>He also owns an artifact known as the Coronetian AIOW, which can take on the form of different tools and weapons.</p>
