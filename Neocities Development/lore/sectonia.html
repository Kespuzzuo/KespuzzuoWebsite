                    <h1>Queen Sectonia</h1>
                    <p><sup>From the Kespuzzuo Lore Compendium</sup></p>
                    <p><b>Sectonia</b>, also known as <b>Queen Sectonia</b>, is a character in the Kespuzzuo Fanwork Corpus, who made her first appearance in <a class="redlink" href="/lore/skygardening.html">Skygardening</a>. She is the Queen of the Floralia.</p>
                    <p>As a character, she originates from the Kirby franchise.</p>
                    <h2 id="Physical_Appearance">Physical Appearance</h2>
                    <p>As a <b>Cloud Spider</b>, she resembles a spider, but yet, there are some things that distinguish her from the common depiction of a spider. She's able to levitate in the air, and her limbs are 6 hands, all of them detached from her body. She's also got long silver hair, that reaches to the middle of her body. Her skin can be described as brown, or "chestnut" colored.</p>
                    <p>On top of her head, she has two yellow horns. On her face, she has two eyes, that lack pupils and bear white sclerae. She's often seen wearing pink eyeliner over those two eyes. Above those eyes, there's another pair of eyes, this time bearing a white color, and having subtle pupils. On the back of hear hear, she's got two additional pairs of eyes, all of them being the same kind as the upper eyes she's got on front of her.</p>
                    <h2 id="History">History</h2>
                    <h3 id="Before_Skygardening">Before Skygardening</h3>
                    <p>Before she was crowned as a Queen, Sectonia befriended <a class="goldlink" href="/lore/taranza.html">Taranza</a>. Since Sectonia was the princess of Floralia, her parents used to bring her to summit meetings, where the rulers of Eden Land and Gentry Land would gather with the Floralian rulers. Sectonia met Lolo and Lala during one of those meetings, and would eventually befriend them.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, after some years, Sectonia became the Queen of Floralia. Despite this, she would still keep a close bond with Taranza.</p>
                    <p>Some years into her reign, she found out that in Popstar, several people have been "corrupted", and quickly found out that they were being affected by mirrors that came from the Mirror World. She imposed a ban on mirrors shortly after, meaning that from that point onwards, all mirrors in Floralia had to be confiscated, and anyone who entered Floralia had to be checked in case they had any mirrors.</p>
                    <p>After realizing that the mirrors and the curse were made by Dark Mind, Sectonia formed the Council of the Seven Years, a team with the mission of defeating Dark Mind. Taranza, Lolo, and Lala joined the council early on. The council would go on excursions towards the Mirror World trying to find a way to reach Dark Mind.</p>
                    <p>The council reached the portal to the Mirror World, and discovered the mirror that led towards Dark Mind, but when they tried to reach it, Dark Meta Knight attacked the council and shattered the mirror, scattering the shards across the Mirror World.</p>
                    <h3 id="Skygardening">Skygardening</h3>
                    <p>When <a class="goldlink" href="/lore/povynn.html">Povynn</a>, <a class="goldlink" href="/lore/emronia.html">Emronia</a>, and <a class="goldlink" href="/lore/quentin.html">Quentin</a> arrived at Floralia, they were inducted into the Council as well. Sectonia happily let them contribute and join the rest of the council in the excursions. The council gathered the pieces of the mirror that led to Dark Mind, and fought him.</p>
                    <h2 id="Abilities">Abilities</h2>
                    <p>Sectonia is skilled at sword combat. She mostly uses a pair of rapiers that can magically become scepters, which can cast offensive magic. One of the scepters is silver, and can unleash "glittering flares", while the other one is golden and can cast purple thunders.</p>
                    <p>She can also summon portals, this allows her to deflect attacks, summon other people, or travel from one place to another.</p>
