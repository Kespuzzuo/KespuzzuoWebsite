                                <p>So it's September now.</p>
                                <p>I already told you that many people like to celebrate Christmas the second that November begins.</p>
                                <p>Turns out that when I was scouting the internet, looking for those who in turn kick off the Halloween celebrations at the start of September, I realized these people do exist, and not only that, but there are people who are annoyed by it (like people who are annoyed by people who celebrate Christmas early)</p>
                                <p>I didn't realize that people took holidays that seriously.</p>
                                <p>And well, I do get them. Imagine how it must feel to go anywhere and seeing everything themed as either scary things filled with bats and spider webs, or filled with snow, elves, and holiday music for two whole months. I've felt that and </p>
                                <p>But maybe the reason Halloween fans and Christmas fans are so passionate about their holidays is because they're timed events, and they have to hold their urges for almost a year.</p>

                                <p>Okay, I'll admit it, I already put on a costume in <a class="purplelink" href="https://namemc.com/skin/796eaf2c306664e1">Minecraft</a>. I dressed myself as Varik (or Ares) from Brandish... and the <span title="Also known as the Earthbound Halloween Hack.">Radiation Halloween Hack</span>.</p>
                                <p>I think it's a funny choice. He's so obscure, yet has some funny things going on.</p>
