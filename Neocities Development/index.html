                                <p class="news_date">December 4, 2024</p>
                                <p>So I heard that people are getting their Spotify Wrapped. Unfortunately, it's for mobile only, and I don't want to go through the ordeal of going from the web app to the mobile app, because I have it set up in a different country so the main page is different. I will not look at my Spotify Wrapped</p>
                                <p>There's an alternative, and possibly something better than Spotify Wrapped: Volt.FM. It gives the same kind of data that Wrapped gives, but I don't have to log into mobile. According to this, the artist I've listened to the most this year was Alicesoft, followed by Mamomo, and then Queen (I was going through their discography for the sake of completion, with the exception of the Flash Gordon album)</p>
                                <p>I'm leaving Spotify, because there's no button or option to stop it from recommending artists I don't like, and neither there's an option for blocking these artists from appearing on recommendations or on ads. I wouldn't give them any penny either, because I don't want to fund them, knowing both their history, and because of the artists they've promoted.</p>
                                <p>I'm still adding songs to the December playlist, but, there will be one final album I'll add, and after that, I'll listen to music on whatever platform I want, while logging what I listen to on RYM.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Regarding life - Let's talk about tomatoes instead</h3>
                                <p>I ate green cocktail tomatoes today, I think they tasted like green apples.</p>
                                <p>I usually tend to have a tomato, or a group of cocktail tomatoes, on the side of my lunch. It's a way to satiate my hunger without consuming a lot of calories. Tomatoes don't have a lot of taste, so I sprinkle a bit of salt, and dip them in mustard. If it's a normal tomato, I just grab it and eat it like an apple, and I don't even peel it. If I'm having cocktail tomatoes, I just pick them up with a fork.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Also, whatever you do, don't use an unripe avocado for a shake. I did that this morning and it didn't blend in, it just became a group of unripe avocado crumbles swimming inside the non-creamy shake I had.</p>
                                <p>I could have waited for the avocados to age, but, I wanted to deplete the milk, because it was close to its expiration date.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Regarding gaming - What I got at the Steam Sale</h3>
                                <p>The Steam Sale is over, and I got Cities Skylines, since it was at a huge discount. I also got Spark the Electric Jester, and Core Keeper. I got Core Keeper because I watched someone play it, and it looked interesting. It's like Minecraft, where you gather resources. It also has mods!</p>
                                <p>But I'll leave these games in the backlog for now, because I'm trying to finish Kirby and the Forgotten Land and a few other games.</p>

                                <p class="news_date">December 1, 2024</p>
                                <p>This year is wrapping up, my house's with all the Christmas decorations, and the TV's playing Christmas ads. It'll be Christmas in no time, and same for the New Year.</p>
                                <p>I'm happy with this year. I promised I would draw at least 60 drawings, and I've managed to draw even more than that. I also promised to finish Skygardening, and here it is! There's three resolutions I want to take care of, which is fixing some things on this website (A proper 404 page, and a proper banner), revealing 2 new characters, and posting 3 tracks of music by me.</p>
                                <p>I'm nearly done with uni for the year, and I'll be getting that bachelor's degree really soon! I'm doing very well at it as well.</p>
                                <p>Also, here's the <a class="purplelink" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/14iF7EqjJ3b1nGiaboaKEZ">November music playlist.</a> Which I believe might be over 100 hours long, with 1707 tracks. Oh, and here's the <a class="purplelink" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Gf9v6N6k8uRKa4fZ8PoPP">December music playlist.</a> I think that'll be the last one, since I'm gonna use RYM's <i>Play History</i> function from now on. I'll also be reviewing some music after listening to it, since that'll leave my mark on the world.</p>
