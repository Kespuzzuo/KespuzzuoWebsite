                            <div class="news_content">
                                <p class="news_date">January 12, 2025</p>
                                <p>Okay, I've decided to make the jump. I have gathered the funds for my next computer, which I'm calling the <b>Pangea Tricouni Station</b>.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>It's called like that because it's named after two places in Whistler BC, it's a running in-joke I have. My current computer is called the Fairmont Audain Station. Fairmont is one of the hotels there, and Audain is the name of a museum in that place. Pangea is the name of a capsule hotel, and Tricouni is the name of a mountain that is close to Whistler.</p>
                                <p>Previously, I mentioned I wanted an AMD 5700X3D for the processor, but, I have decided to instead pick a 7800X3D. The reason behind this is that I will buy and build most of the computer right now, and then later buy the GPU. The 5700X3D doesn't have integrated graphics, so if I had picked that one, I would have been forced to buy the GPU immediatly.</p>
                                <p>This means I will be getting an AM5 motherboard instead of an AM4 motherboard. People say this is good, since I will be able to upgrade later in the future. However, I'm not sure I would need to buy a new CPU for the rest of the computer's lifespan. The 7800X3D is already so good, it wouldn't be a wise decision to move to that to a 9800X3D or a 9950X3D. It might be good for 8 years even. And even if AMD releases an late-AM5 top-tier CPU (let's say, a 19800X3D), the 7800X3D would still be able to accomplish what I want at that time. So, in the far future, when I need another computer, I might wait until AM6 is good enough.</p>
                                <p>I have a motherboard already on my radar, it's got 3 slots for NVME drives, and at the moment I'm thinking of just pulling my laptop's SSD and plugging it into my new computer. I won't have to deal with installing everything again, and I'm saving some money by doing that. The memory should be DDR5 now, and I got a good 2x16 kit on my radar, it runs at 6000MT/s, I think that's also something that will last a while without getting obsolete.</p>
                                <p>The cooler, a Thermalright Peerless Assasin. I heard that one is good. The case, a Corsair 4000D Airflow, which I also heard is good. The PSU will be a 850 Watt one, to make room for whenever I get that GPU.</p>
                                <p>I found a $50 dollar RGB keyboard, that'll do for now. And, as for the monitor, I'll be using the portable monitor I got for Christmas. I'll later upgrade by getting a monitor meant for desktop PCs, and just use the portable monitor as the second monitor afterwards. As I said before, I like gaming at 1080p with a high refresh rate, so this build is meant to be like that, more focus on the CPU and not so much on the GPU.</p>
                                <p>So, at the pace I'm earning money, I think I'll be able to fund the GPU by the end of February. No worries if I don't make it by then, I still have some retro games and some Minecraft to play. I'm still building that 16x16 chunk pyramid on Minecraft. I bet I'll be able to put a 32 chunk distance on the new build.</p>
