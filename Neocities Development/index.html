                                <h3>Regarding Food - The Box Combo</h3>
                                <p>My city doesn't have a Raising Cane's, so I decided to make my own Box Combo. First thing I prepared was the sauce. This sauce includes ketchup, mayo, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I thought I wouldn't find Worcestershire sauce, but, apparently, I was able to find it. I never had it before. I made the sauce, and showed it to my family. My mom at first thought it was just mayo with ketchup, and I mentioned that it was like that but with more ingredients. She also mentioned it was too salty. I'm used to make my food saltier than other cooks do, so maybe this is just a "me" thing.</p>
                                <p>After that I made the coleslaw, I just picked up a salad kit (of green lettuce, purple lettuce, and carrot slices), and added mayo, pepper and lemon to it. Then I cooked the crinkle cut fries on the oven, the chicken on the air fryer, and also added the Texas Toast to the air fryer before the chicken was ready. The whole thing actually yielded two "servings", both of them apparently bigger due to the amount of fries, coleslaw, and sauce that I made. I served myself a homemade Box Combo with a can of Dr Pepper and enjoyed it.</p>

                                <h3>Regarding gaming - Rocket League</h3>
                                <p>I played Rocket League for the first time and got hooked in pretty much instantly.</p>
                                <p>I know it was pretty popular years ago, but never bothered to play it. A week ago I saw a pic mocking one of the Nascar cars going airborne, with the Rocket League logo at the bottom. I also realized it's on the Epic "Epic MegaGames" Mega-launcher. So I made an account there, and downloaded the Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
                                <p>Plus, since my new computer is like... an "Esports computer", I thought it would be adequate to play some of it.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Speaking of Esports, I also wanted to mention that I played Marvel Rivals yesterday, but, I'm gonna admit, I'm not good at it. Nothing unusual, since this is the first time playing it. I think I'd have to study strats before playing again.</p>
