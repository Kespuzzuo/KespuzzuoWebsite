                                <p>This year is wrapping up, my house's with all the Christmas decorations, and the TV's playing Christmas ads. It'll be Christmas in no time, and same for the New Year.</p>
                                <p>I'm happy with this year. I promised I would draw at least 60 drawings, and I've managed to draw even more than that. I also promised to finish Skygardening, and here it is! There's three resolutions I want to take care of, which is fixing some things on this website (A proper 404 page, and a proper banner), revealing 2 new characters, and posting 3 tracks of music by me.</p>
                                <p>I'm nearly done with uni for the year, and I'll be getting that bachelor's degree really soon! I'm doing very well at it as well.</p>
                                <p>Also, here's the <a class="purplelink" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/14iF7EqjJ3b1nGiaboaKEZ">November music playlist.</a> Which I believe might be over 100 hours long, with 1707 tracks. Oh, and here's the <a class="purplelink" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Gf9v6N6k8uRKa4fZ8PoPP">December music playlist.</a> I think that'll be the last one, since I'm gonna use RYM's <i>Play History</i> function from now on. I'll also be reviewing some music after listening to it, since that'll leave my mark on the world.</p>
