                                <p>So it's November now. I originally planned to take a break from drawing and doing other fine arts during this month, but I thought it would be better to keep the momentum going.</p>
                                <p>With that new site with the butterfly that I set up, I feel like I got a motivation to keep going and going. I'm trying to get as many followers as I can, and rewarding them each time we reach a milestone.</p>
                                <p>By the way, here's the <a class="purplelink" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1KXkvjc59Pv5PrcGjppz1b">October music playlist.</a></p>

                                <p>But, yes. We're 2 months away from 2025. We're now at that time of the year where people are working really hard to meet deadlines and build their end-of-year projects. Oh! The drama is building up, the pace is picking up so fast!</p>
                                <p>As for me. Well, for me it'll be doing art orders and the remaining "events" of the year. I had no idea of what to do with the money I earned from drawing. Games? No, I already have a huge backlog across multiple platforms. Art? I draw art for myself. I want to look at my future, and tell myself that part of this money will be used to pay a portion of the downpayment for an eventual place of my own. Some of this money will also be used as an emergency fund.</p>
