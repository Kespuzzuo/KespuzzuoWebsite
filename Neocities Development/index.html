                                <p>It's not ready yet, I'm planning to start posting it on the 24th of October.</p>
                                <p>That makes me think... How should I fill the first half of the event.</p>
                                <p>Teasers... it could be teasers about the characters.</p>
                                <p>However, this project has such a "wham episode" pacing to it, it's hard to tease stuff without spoiling what there is to come.</p>

                                <p class="news_date">Sep 17, 2024</p>
                                <p>Last night I watched the End of Evangelion. I think it felt like a more concentrated, more over the top, and more "wtf moment" filled entry in comparison to the tv show.</p>
                                <p>But what should I watch next?</p>
                                <p>I decided that I'll watch Gurren Lagann. It was made by Gainax too, and it feels like "the other side of the coin", as in, that it's also a mecha anime, but, unlike Evangelion, it is more uplifting.</p>
                                <p>I do get the themes of Evangelion, of facing reality and dealing with socialization. But now, I want to look at the bright side of life, of gathering the motivation to kick problems in the face.</p>
                                <p>And, after this, I think I'll be checking out other of Hiroyuki Imaishi's works. I love the style he pulls off, the speed, the cartooniness, the clothes the characters wear, and how in-your-face his works are.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Also, I promise I'll finish Kirby Star Allies, I'm at the last world.</p>

                                <p>I watched episodes 25 and 26 today.</p>

                                <h3>Regarding life - Cooking</h3>
                                <p>Today I cooked chicken thighs with the air fryer I got at home! It's my first time doing it, and I think I did it pretty well! All I needed was watching recipes and tutorials on the internet.</p>
                                <p>The first thing I did was adding seasonings, which consisted of salt, pepper, garlic, and lemon juice.</p>
                                <p>The air fryer was preheated to 375 Fahrenheit (190 Celsius) When I got the chicken there, I applied some oil spray, and let it cook for 15 minutes at 375 F, I then flipped the chicken, applied oil again and got it cooked for 15 more minutes. And that was it!</p>
                                <p>This resulted in some tasty chicken thighs, with a fully cooked and smooth texture, a slightly strong flavor, and crunchy skin.</p>

                                <h3>Regarding gaming - Block game</h3>
                                <p>I just wanted to mention that I post modded Minecraft stuff on <a class="purplelink" href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/kespuzzuo/wall">Planet Minecraft</a>. Sometimes I do it on the Youtube community tab, but that place crops the pics I upload. Maybe one day I'll post a second let's play video. Thing is, it'll look so different from the last video, that it'll resemble those "I did some off-camera mining" videos. I got so OP in the modpack, that it feels like I'm playing in creative mode. So the challenge while playing in my Minecraft world is not surviving, but of figuring out what to build, and finishing that massive pyramid mega-base.</p>

                                <p class="news_date">Sep 11, 2024</p>
                                <p>So, this website works on Firefox, that's what I use here on my computer. It also works on Chrome, which is what I use on my phone. I used a website to test this website on other browsers and operating systems, and realized this site works fine on most modern browsers, with Safari being the exception, since it doesn't render it correctly.</p>
                                <p>Thing is, Safari is like... an Apple exclusive browser. Yes, you can get Safari 5, but that's way too old. macOS Sonoma seems to use Safari 17, and Sequoia uses Safari 18 (which curiously enough, actually runs the website the correct way)</p>
                                <p>There's almost no Apple things at my household, we have the idea that Apple is <span title="Le bad"><i>Le Mal Incarne</i></span> and that alternatives do more for less. The only Apple thing I know I have is Quicktime Player on my second laptop.</p>
                                <p>So I would have to use the browser testing website to test my website on Safari, but the problem is that it runs on a free trial that only allows one minute of usage and that's it. Then I would have to pay a monthly subscription to get to test my website on Safari again.</p>
                                <p>So I decided to install QEMU on my computer and run a virtual machine of that one Unix-based operating system that a lot of people in my campus use. Finally, unlimited testing for me.</p>
                                <p>I think very few people use Safari. Whenever someone's screen sharing a Mac at Uni... they have Chrome open instead of Safari. I have no idea why they turn down Safari, hahah.</p>
                                <p>But yes, there's now compatibility for Safari, so Apple users can enjoy this site.</p>

                                <p class="news_date">Sep 10, 2024</p>
                                <p>Last week I mentioned my plans for acquiring a new computer. But I want to make clear that I want to make my current computer last. It might probably last 4 more years, or even 6 years if I'm lucky.</p>
                                <p>There are two things that might determine that lifespan for me. First thing is the screen, which glitches, but this only happens when I keep the refresh rate at 144hz. I do not know if it will start glitching at 60hz. If that happens, I might look for a new computer, while keeping the current one plugged to my tv or a cheap hdmi screen.</p>
                                <p>There are ways I can take care of my screen. I now only open and close the lid from the middle of the top, since that's the correct way to move the lid. And I do it slowly.</p>
                                <p>The other factor is the battery health, as in, how well the battery works, not how much energy it contains. For a whole month, my computer said it was at 51%, but by the time I'm writing this, for some reason, it says it's at 71%. I have no idea how it jumped from 51% to 71%, maybe it was from carrying it in my backpack while going to the campus and having the components move "in the right direction". I'll think of getting a new computer if it reaches a health of 10%.</p>
                                <p>I'm being careful with my laptop's battery, I keep the charging limit at 60% now.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>The September update</h3>
                                <p>I promised that at the end of this month I'll do a big update to this site.</p>
                                <p>But before I get to it, I believe I should write down what I want to change:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Making graphics for the top-bar's buttons</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Yes, these buttons that say <i>Home</i>, <i>Lore</i> and <i>Projects</i>. I've always planned to style these buttons as clickable images. I want to give more life to my site.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The <i>Projects</i> button</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I've got to add my projects! In there, I'll list works such as the PMD comic, Skygardening, and upcoming projects such as the Robobot arc prelude and the Robobot Visual Novel.</p>
                                <p>Each project will have an encyclopedia article, and a link to the work itself.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The timeline</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Here's another thing that I teased but haven't started, the timeline of the events of my works.</p>
                                <p>I don't wanna make it as just a list of years where it says "here's what happened on this year, and here's what happened on the following year", I want to make it look like an actual line, a graphic with a line that goes from above to below showing each event as a branch.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>New header graphic</li>
                                    <li>New background</li>
                                    <li>Giving more life and detail to the graphics</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <p>And that's what I want to make. I think the theme of this update is... fulfilling the goals I've had since I started this site.</p>

                                <p class="news_date">Sep 8, 2024</p>
                                <p>I don't watch shows too much, but, when I do, I like to watch the ones that are considered groundbreaking, or special. I think Neon Genesis Evangelion is often described as such, and on top of it, it's not a long anime, it's just 26 episodes (and a movie) long.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes I am astonished by those anime that last hundreds of episodes (you know which ones I'm talking about, those adventure shonen that get on <i>JUMP</i> and then get a show and keep getting season after season), and I'm also astonished by people who got the stamina to watch all of it. I have watched some, but never finished any. The last long anime I was watching was Dragon Ball, which is at 46 episodes.</p>
                                <p>But yes, Evangelion. What interested me is that there's a lot of things that somehow lead to Evangelion. Several Kirby bosses look like the angels. The show talks about psychology (I study psychology) And sometimes it gets referenced in other shows, games, and other stuff (either directly or as an inspiration)</p>
                                <p>I think some things are neat, like the (either funny or sad) moments the characters have outside of battles. But, I am not finished with it, I might talk more about it when I finish it.</p>

                                <p class="news_date">Sep 6, 2024</p>
                                <p>I'm learning more about making food. I already know how to cook on a pan, and an air fryer. I've had stuff deep fried too. But of course, I'm missing one important technique: baking on an oven.</p>
                                <p>I looked up recipes for brownies, and most of them called for pre-heating the oven. Thankfully I was told that I just need to put on mitts and put my face away while opening the oven after it pre-heats and after baking the food.</p>
                                <p>So yes, I'm planning to make brownies, and making them fudgy. For this, I believe I have to not use a lot of flour, and not a lot of the egg white whenever I'm adding the eggs.</p>
                                <p>I'm a fan of fudgy confections, I don't have much of a thing for desserts like sponge cakes. I much prefer cheesecakes, they got so much flavor inside... not like those sponge cakes.</p>
                                <p>The thing I have with sponge cakes and similar confections is that they don't have too much of a sense of reward or pleasure when I eat them (in comparison to other confections)</p>

                                <p>I heard that the Internet Archive wasn't having it very well, so I'm here to tell you that Skygardening will be posted on other sites for people to read.</p>
                                <p>Thing is, Skygardening has an <i>Infinite Jest</i>-like structure where some footnotes tell you to read an endnote with some story in it. The footnotes with lore, info and commentary are also important. I think it'll be a bit harder to pull that style of writing on a site like Fanfiction.net or AO3. It might take some learning.</p>

                                <p>Each month, I make a playlist on Spotify to store any new track I listened to. Here's the <a class="purplelink" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/17kaZuNp650iG9q8VF87Ul">one that I made last month</a>. I managed to listen to over 24 hours of music that month, which is rare! I think it must have been because I've put it as background music while reading, studying, doing this website, and gaming.</p>
                                <p>It has a lot of ambient music, especially Ultimae Records albums. I like the Mirror's Edge soundtrack, which made me get into Solar Fields, which later got me into other ambient artists.</p>
                                <p>There's some Dreams Come True in there, since I want to listen to all of their studio albums. There's Journey, Huey Lewis & the News, and Tommy Flanagan too.</p>

                            <div class="news_content">
                                <p class="news_date">Sep 2, 2024</p>
                                <p>So I've been using my third laptop (which I've called the Fairmont Audain Station) for nearly 4 years. The first and second laptops I've used were used for 3 years each.</p>
                                <p>But I think I plan to keep this laptop for a 5th year or a 6th year if I'm lucky. This all depends on some conditions.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Just the price of the computer itself</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>So this is considered a gaming laptop, I got it with a 10th gen intel i7, an RTX 2060 mobile, and 16 GB of RAM, which I later updated to 32 GB. This all costed like 1200 dollars, so, I want to make it worth, because if I use it for 5 years, it would mean each year was 240 dollars worth, and if it's 6 years, each year would cost 200 dollars.</p>
                                <p>I think the life cycle of this computer depends on some factors. Initially I worried about the SSD's life, but, according to a terminal app I used to check it's health, the SSD has only used like 10% of it's real capacity during these 4 years, so it can last for long. Though, the other two things that tend to worry me are the battery and the screen. The battery has like 50% of health, because for like the first year I didn't know that I was meant to charge up to 80% rather than 100%. The other thing is the monitor, which now has problems rendering while being at 144hz, so I have to keep it at 60hz.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Waiting for AMD's Zen 5 or Intel's Arrow Lake CPUs</li>
                                    <li>Waiting for Nvidia's 50 series</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>So the thing about waiting for the next generation of processors and graphics cards is that of course they'll have some improvements, and that they might also make the previous generations cheaper. That might also mean that a cpu or gpu or a lower end in a newer generation can be as powerful as a high-end one from a previous generation.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>The stuff that'll matter for me</h3>
                                <p>A lot of people tend to say that it's better to have a desktop pc, but the problem is that I still want to be able to carry my computer ocassionally to the campus or somewhere else. And the other thing I got is that when I have a laptop, I don't have to worry about blackouts, since I'll have time to save things up and finish anything I got.</p>
                                <p>Here's a list of things I'll be thinking whenever I look for that computer.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Backlit keyboard</li>
                                    <li>Being able to upgrade to 32 GB of RAM</li>
                                    <li>An SSD of one terabyte</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Normally, I tend to store a lot of things on external drives, because my second laptop failed and lost a lot of things that were inside the hard drive. Thankfully it came back to life and I was able to recover some things. But, after seeing how good an SSD is, I don't want to come back to using a spinning drive as my main storage. I also tend to dual boot between Linux and Windows. I know there was a problem where a Windows update caused Linux to become unavailable, but thankfully there was a solution for that. I think I want to be able to fit a second SSD inside, but I have no idea on how to get the screws that are used to keep the SSD in place.</p>
                                <p>Most games on Steam in Linux also demand me to have them on the SSD to work, because in Linux, the partition that the system is on is an ext4 one, while the external drive (that I use on both Windows and Linux) is NTFS, and Steam games in Linux don't like being in NTFS file systems. The solution I've had is that I only install the ones that I'm currently played, and that I uninstall the ones I'm not using.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A good cpu (and a fast igpu)</li>
                                    <li>A fast dedicated GPU</li>
                                    <li>Good cooling</li>
                                    <li>A CPU and a GPU that don't get too hot</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I've noticed that when playing games, the GPU does little but still generates a lot of heat. Maybe it's because this is like one of the earliest and cheapest RTX cards ever, or maybe because it's a laptop one and uses the laptop fans rather than it's own fans. But, I've had moments where using the CPU works better than the GPU because it gets less hot, and it still works well.</p>
                                <p>And in situations where I have to choose between Intel's integrated gpu and the cpu itself to compute stuff, the one that works better is the cpu itself. I think AMD has better igpus in their cards, so, I think I'll be thinking of getting an AMD instead of an intel this time around.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Three USB ports</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>So, when I'm using this computer, I need three USB ports to do my work. The first port is used for my external drive, the second one is used for my mouse, and the third one is used for either the drawing tablet, or a microphone, or a music keyboard, or any other stuff. The laptop I currently use has three USB ports and one USB-C port. I've noticed that the most recent laptops that are coming out come with two USB ports and two USB-C ports.</p>
                                <p>If I have no choice, I think I got some options. I might get a dongle that converts USB to USB-C, or I might replace my external drive with one that uses an USB C port. I think the latter might be the better solution</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Refresh rate</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>For me, a 144hz refresh rate is great, and enough for everything that I want. But I'm still happy with a 60hz refresh rate.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Battery duration</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I want the battery to be able to have a long lifecycle, but, I don't mind if it's short in terms of "how many minutes or hours can I use this laptop without plugging it in". Though, this does matter in cases when there's a blackout, but they don't happen very often.</p>
                                <h3>Stuff I don't mind.</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Camera</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I don't care about having a camera. My current laptop doesn't have one, and if I ever want to use a camera, I can use my phone as a camera that is fed into my laptop, there's an app for that.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Resolution</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I'm still pretty much fine with an 1080p resolution. I think I would even be fine with a 720p resolution. A higher resolution means that there will be more pixels to work on, so that will most likely affect the performance.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Size</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I'm completely fine with having a huge laptop, I don't have problems carrying it. I think it's good for a laptop to be big, so that way it can fit the fans and other components, and can have a good airflow.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>And that's what I'm expecting as of now. I'm just writing it down for whenever the time comes.</p>

                                <p>Apparently, AMD already released the Zen 5 processors. While this is true, what I mean is that I'm waiting for laptops that have Zen 5 processors at a reasonable price, or waiting for Zen 4 laptops to have a lower price.</p>

                                <p>So it's September now.</p>
                                <p>I already told you that many people like to celebrate Christmas the second that November begins.</p>
                                <p>Turns out that when I was scouting the internet, looking for those who in turn kick off the Halloween celebrations at the start of September, I realized these people do exist, and not only that, but there are people who are annoyed by it (like people who are annoyed by people who celebrate Christmas early)</p>
                                <p>I didn't realize that people took holidays that seriously.</p>
                                <p>And well, I do get them. Imagine how it must feel to go anywhere and seeing everything themed as either scary things filled with bats and spider webs, or filled with snow, elves, and holiday music for two whole months. I've felt that and </p>
                                <p>But maybe the reason Halloween fans and Christmas fans are so passionate about their holidays is because they're timed events, and they have to hold their urges for almost a year.</p>

                                <p>Okay, I'll admit it, I already put on a costume in <a class="purplelink" href="https://namemc.com/skin/796eaf2c306664e1">Minecraft</a>. I dressed myself as Varik (or Ares) from Brandish... and the <span title="Also known as the Earthbound Halloween Hack.">Radiation Halloween Hack</span>.</p>
