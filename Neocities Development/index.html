                                <p>I made brownies! This was the first time I actually baked pastry. I thought brownies would make a good first recipe, since they're delicious, and don't take many steps, since you only have to dump the mix into a tray, without having to make little balls or use a cookie cutter.</p>
                                <p>One thing I learned is that making a whole tray of brownies requires an entire bar of butter. I see brownies in a different way now, since I will now look at a brownie and think it has like a ninth of a butter bar inside, which when used on a bread is plenty... well, I have also used plenty of butter to make garlic bread. Turns out you can turn (almost) any bread into garlic bread by melting butter on it, adding garlic powder and herbs, and then toasting it in the oven.</p>

                                <p>I'm getting to World 5 of Yoshi's Island and the difficulty spike is real!</p>
                                <p>Perhaps Nintendo knew the Super Mario World could be cheesed by either knowing the warps or by using the cape, and decided to challenge people with this game. The start is easy, but, it does get hard.</p>
                                <p>I don't really worry a lot, I got plenty of lives, and I think this game was made at the point where losing all the lives only made you like... start from the start of the level or world instead of the start of the game.</p>
                                <p>It's fine, though.</p>
