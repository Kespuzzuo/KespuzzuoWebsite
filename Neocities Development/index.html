                                <p class="news_date">June 4, 2025</p>
                                <p>If Ralsei dies on Chapter 3 or 4... I'll eat my own hat and draw Van Arkride giving Ralsei a Toblerone, and Ralsei telling Van "Oh, Van, you're a life saver" (cue a panel of Van thinking he's one of these ring shaped gummies)</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>But, being honest. I think it's unlikely that Ralsei will betray Kris and Susie, or that Ralsei will, woosh, be turned to dust. Among the first ideas that Radiation had for Deltarune, there were the ending and the Fun Gang. I believe that the ending might be similar to that part of the legend that has the three heroes (these being Kris, Susie, and Ralsei) banish the Angel's Heaven. On the newest trailers, there's an animation that depicts the trio facing some kind of angel. This gives me the idea that the Fun Gang will stick for long during the game, up to the ending.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>I think Ralsei might just be Ralsei based on that. I think the theory that Ralsei is a titan might be right. But, I do not believe that Ralsei is Kris' headband, that's because Ralsei and Kris are nothing alike, end of the story.</p>
                                <p>That theory that Ralsei is a dead version of Asriel... might be possible, but it falls down once I remember that Toriel mentions Asriel coming back at the start of the game. I also don't think Asriel is pretending to be Ralsei, because Asriel is busy with uni, and it's unlikely that he would have the free time to do everything that Ralsei does. There's another possibility that the hooded prince in the legend isn't Ralsei, but another prince instead, who happens to wear a hood.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>I think it's very likely that Chapter 3 will have a secret boss, but, hell no if it's just Woody. I can't take that meme seriously... but maybe that Cheshire cat might appear</p>
                                <p>Let's see what else could be there... I think the other classmates will be party members, Toriel and Undyne appearing in the Chapter 3 Dark World too. The knight... could be the mayor. Gaster... wouldn't appear until near the end of the game, and could be evil. Gaster (or at least MysteryMan) is inspired by Uboa, so there might be a "true" form to Gaster that is different from MysteryMan.</p>
                                <p>There'll be Dragon Blazers, and Super Smashing Fighters, as games that people will be able to play in-game. That's what I'm feeling will happen, though.</p>
                                <p>And that's all I believe I have for predictions. At least that's what came up to my mind tonight.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Thank you so much for coming to today's "Almost daily" post.</p>
                                <p>I'll be off social media whenever the game comes out. I'll be having a busy day this Wednesday.</p>

                                <p>I started playing Trails in the Sky FC.</p>
                                <p>Trails is like... it feels like an authentic RPG, and a modern one, still serving soda the old fashioned way. It's not a parody, but, more of a refinement of what an RPG can do, mostly talking about long stories, worldbuilding, and turn-based combat. It's like a love letter and a continuation of what JRPGs have been doing in the 90s.</p>
                                <p>One thing to keep in mind is that all the games in the franchise (except for the Nayuta game) are a continuous story, so the fans recommend to start with the first game and then follow the order. The first game is good though. I heard the second one is even better.</p>
                                <p>Oh yeah! I forgot to mention. The Trails games are made by Falcom, which is the same company that made Brandish. Trails is probably the most famous Falcom franchise, probably tied with Ys.</p>
